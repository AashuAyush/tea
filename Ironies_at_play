India is so heterogenous and diverse that multiple ironies are at play simultaneously, almost always. The heart fills with warmth but also cringes at the same time.

Born into Islam as Roshanara Khan, converted to Hinduism for love and (allegedly) gave up on public appearances, the sole desire of an artist to present what they do, that again for unrequited, lost love. Annapurna Devi, as she was called, from Maihar gharana, was amongst the most outstanding teachers of Hindustani music. We lost her on 13th October.

Meanwhile the country which preaches 'Vasudev Kutumbkam', takes pride in calling itself the largest democracy and is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi, sees unprecedented elections in Kashmir with turnout below even five percent and migrants being chased out of rich states. Sure we are upholding the values of our Constitution, namely to provide political justice to citizens and freedom of vocation to all in independent India.

Anarchy rules against the verdict of the highest court of land on Sabrimala while the other Gandhi visits every other temple, making sure the photographs are taken for the next day's newspapers. Elections are coming, you know.

M J Akbar steps down but slams a defamation suit, something he would have himself critised while practicing as a journalist. Maybe the other Akbar, who is being erased out of out history, gradually but steadily, was wrong when he identified the pluralistic Ganga-Jamuna culture of a city and named it Ilahabad, the city of all Gods. 

While all this goes on, we Indians and our future generations, as have always been grossly ignorant and ill-informed of our history, will forget the legends of the Univeristy of Allahabad and the High Court of Allahabad.

All these things and experiences, each one of them changes something in me every day, however miniscule it might be. Alas, I learn only at losses. Hope this doesnot turn out to be for India.
