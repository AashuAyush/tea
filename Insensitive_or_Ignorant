Dr G D Agarwal dies. One day later, IIT Roorkee organises Dandia night. There is no stir in the campus. No procession, no candlelight vigil, but utter normalcy. The student media body is silent. Even the management knows nothing.


Who he was? An IIT Roorkee alumnus, a University of California-trained environmental engineer, former Head of Department - Civil Engineering at IIT Kanpur, the first member secretary of the Central Pollution Control Board and also a board member of the National Ganga Basin Authority, until he resigned in 2012. He died on 11th October 2018, after observing 112 days fast for 'Aviral' (uninterrupted flow) and 'Nirmal' (clean) Ganga and for the government to wake up, that it was already high time to actually act and save the holy river.


They say universities are budding grounds for ideas and reformers. I heard, a dhoti-clad man could once shake the entire nation and its foreign rulers by the instrument of his fasts. Things have surely changed. A man like G D Agarwal could grow out from the University of Roorkee. Probably, while gaining the IIT tag, it might have lost something more imporatant.


Hopefully, tomorrow we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Dr Kalam.
