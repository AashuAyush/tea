is there anything like absolute trust in this world?

only when one side cares more for the other side than oneself. Being animals, when facing the gravest of situations won't we go back to our primitive ways, survival. No matter what I have always wondered how people are able to hold up and act in such situations. Until one has not faced the situation, the tales of bravery can't be known. In fact, it's those very situations which make one brave or prove one to be a coward.
People would definitely act for their benefit. 
Sometime i might have put in absolute trust in some people. The breach of that one sided expectation did more harm for myself. A blow to beliefs, a loss on confidence in myself. I had once decided not to expect out of the ordinary from my life. In a passage of a few years, I forgot my resolve and it has brought me back to full circle. Was my expectatation that i imposed was the bad thing, that i judged them, felt like i have successfully understood an abyss that is human.
