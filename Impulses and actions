Impulses and actions

often i am in doubt, reading about accounts of bravery what i would do in such situations. How do I know how I might behave, when self
discovery is a life long process. 

I used to think there would be some incident that would define my course of live, something so pathbreaking that would just change me 
and my life. That never came, all the changes that have been inculcated or adopted have been over time and efforts of my conscious 
choices. No drastic measures, nothing.

I am bent to react on impulses, at seemly unintened situations, even when they were not required. 

I am in doubt, what might the best course of action be. Should I let the course of action take place, sit in the corner, quietly. 
Then there will be guilt, that I did not do the needy, but again if I do wrong on impulse, not taking the entire scenario in picture, there
might be consequences, very bad. The worst among all, hurting someone. 

So is it correct that whatever the impulse might be, however hurt or heart-broken we ourselves are, just never break someone's heart?
Or expand it further, don't let others break someone's heart as well.
