In our lives, we find many individuals attractive amd interesting, there is an inner calling to get to know the person. But alas, 
i am not able to approach everyone. Some fears, those of awkward situations or effort gone waste come in between. 

I feel it's a total probability we get to know someone, 
Recently I had started despising people as doing worthless things, but I felt, how can I ever understand the experiences I have never had.

I thought I should be having more fun than others, then again, how do we measure fun. Isn't it the most intangible thing, just like happiness

I often have to challenge myself to do the needful. More than often, I don't have the courage to take the first step myself. There are
friends around who unknowingly help me out at present. But how do I change, start taking the initiative by myself.

About the individuals, don't we meet to leave each other behind, following own journey and just a promise to meet again sometime in the 
future. A future that never comes?

how to discover myself, is this life all about understanding my own self, cause with every setback or opportunity, I am able to know 
myself through my own actions. I want to do so much, many extreme things, to all those experiments and to make all those experiences mine.
In fact, to discover myself.
