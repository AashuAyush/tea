Silence is golden
Relations need conversations to sustain,

How beautiful the world would be if there was no need to converse, but what needs to be conveyed is done naturally
there would be no scope of lies, no doubt, complete trust

every thing i do, i have to be strong personally if i want to keep doing it. There will be self-doubt, concern, image problem!

Over time I have come to realize that i love silence, more like a biased thing. If given the choice, i would choose silence. 

Maybe that's why the closest i have ever come to a dog is with one that seldom barks. 

But i understand, every thing cannot be conveyed through silence. The very base it is a conversation. So that the one across understands what you say.
